          quote="A combination of workbook, journal, and project guide, it is designed to keep that age group interested and involved. Children in that tween and teen age sometime have a hard time finding things to motivate themselves in school. What's Your Red Rubber Ball?! may provide the encouragement they need, to see beyond their here-and-now problems and find something they can dream for."
